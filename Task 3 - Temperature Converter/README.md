# Temperature Converter

◉ This Repo showcases my project, that I've created for my Internship task at Oasis Infobyte.

◉ The website provides a simple and user-friendly interface for converting temperatures between different units, including Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

◉ The temperature conversion functionality enables users to enter a temperature value in any of the supported units and instantly view the converted value in the desired unit. This allows users to conveniently convert temperatures between the commonly used units without the need for manual calculations.

◉ Whether you need to convert a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Kelvin to Celsius, or any other combination, this website simplifies the process and provides accurate results.

◉ The website's intuitive design and responsiveness ensure a seamless experience across various devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user interface for any device.
